We do not give payment processors permission to disclose or use any of our data for any other purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will refuse government and law enforcement requests for personal information if we believe a request is too broad or unrelated to its stated purpose. However, we may decide to cooperate if we believe the requested information is necessary and appropriate to comply with legal process, to protect our own rights and property, to protect the safety of the public and any person, to prevent a crime, or to prevent what we reasonably believe to be illegal, legally actionable, or unethical activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not otherwise share or supply personal information to third parties. We do not sell or rent personal information of our users to marketers or third parties.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-foreground">Processing of Information Subject to User Consent</h3>
      <p>
        Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between user and us, such as when, after having browsed our Website, user requests us to provide more information about our business, including about our services, we may request the user to provide consent to us in order to process information that may be personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wherever practicable, we aim to obtain explicit user consent to process personal information. Sometimes user might give consent implicitly, such as when user sends us a message containing personal information by email to which user expects us to reply.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we communicate with users about our business, we will use the contact information provided to us to discuss technical issues, services, and other information of interest to users. We may also send users email messages containing useful information and promotional information about our business. Except where a particular user has consented to our use of user information for a specific purpose, we will not use any of user&apos;s information in any way that would identify the user personally.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will continue to process user information on this basis until user withdraws consent or it can be reasonably assumed that user consent is no longer valid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each user may withdraw consent at any time by instructing us using the contact information at the end of this Policy, or changing user elections within our Website. However, if user does so, he or she may no longer be able to use our Website or CriptoCard Services.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-foreground">Legally Required Disclosure of Information</h3>
      <p>
        We may be legally required to disclose user personal information, if such disclosure is:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
        <li>required by subpoena, law, or other legal process;</li>
        <li>necessary to assist law enforcement officials or governmental authorities;</li>

      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-foreground">Other Legitimate Interest</h3>
      <p>
        We may process information or use it to communicate with users on the basis that doing so is necessary to achieve a legitimate interest, either to a particular user or to us. Where we use user information on this basis, we do so after having given careful consideration to:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
        <li>whether the same objective could be achieved through other means;</li>
        <li>whether processing (or not processing) might cause a particular user any harm;</li>
        <li>whether the user would expect us to process his or her data, and whether the user would consider it reasonable to do so.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, we may process user data or communicate with the user for any of the following purposes:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
        <li>operating our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and conducting research;</li>
        <li>record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our business;</li>

        <li>insuring against or obtaining professional advice that is required to manage business risk; and/or protecting the interests of any particular user where we believe we have a duty to do so.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will continue to use this information for this purpose until the legitimate interest no longer exists or such use is not necessary to achieve the legitimate interest.
      </p>

      <p>
